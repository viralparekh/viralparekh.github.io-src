Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Ramanathan Subramanian](https://sites.google.com/site/raamsubram){:target="_blank"} at [Center for Visual Information Technology (CVIT)](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in){:target="_blank"} with primary area of research in Computer Vision and Human-Computer Interface.

Prior to my Masters, I worked as a Software Engineer at Samsung Research Institute, Noida(India) for 2 years on Android Telephony Framework. As an independent Android developer, I have published several android applications on Google Play Store with total 3,00,000+ downloads.

<!-- I am also interested in IOT (Internet of Things) based applications. I have worked on a prototype version of [Home Automation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4GONfWZHNA){:target="_blank"} system as a hobby project.
